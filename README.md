# VerifyCrypto - CS50X Project

Preface:
In 2021 over $10 Billion of investor's money have been stolen through various scams, mostly through fraudulent transactions. Our goal with VerifyCrypto is to help people recognize legitimate (or not-so-legitmate) cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges so that these investors don't lose their life savings.

We've created a database of curated exchanges, investment firms and wallets to help investors find the best platforms for them. With an easy to use search function, it's a breeze to find what you're looking for.

Stack:
VerifyCrypto is built with Flask, Python, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.
